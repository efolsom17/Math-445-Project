Plan is to investigate how Monte Carlo simulation is used in the process of calculating WPA in baseball. I want to research into 
how winning/run expectancy is used in monte carlo simulation to craete a win expectancy graph throughout the stages of a game. We are interested in how these methods can be applied to sports betting simulations.

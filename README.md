# MATH 445 Project Spring 2022
Simulation study involving MLB play by play data using MCMC methods attempting to simulate an MLB game between two teams for predicting the number of runs scored in a specific game. Ended up being a better indicator of a teams' overall performance on the season. Could have definitely used better data sources. Might return to this project at a later date.
